{QUESTION}
How do I use themes? (Desktop)
{KEYS}
theme
themed
themes
themesd
themedesktop
themesdesktop
{VALUE}
Since version 1.0, Telegram Desktop supports custom themes, so you can choose an alternative design for your app.

Try it out with some themes from here: @Themes.

To set a theme, click on its file. A preview will open and if you like it you can click "Apply this Theme". The theme will now be applied, click on "Keep Changes" if you want to keep the new theme.

If you want to go back to the default theme, tap the main menu icon near the search field > Settings > scroll down to "Chat background" > "Use default color theme".

Here’s a detailed guide on themes if you’d like one:

Can't take screenshots anywhere (Android)
{COMMENT}
For screenshots in secret chats, see ‘screensecreta’.
{KEYS}
screena
noscreena
screenshota
noscreenshota
screenshotandroid
noscreenshotandroid
{VALUE}
With the recent updates to Telegram, screenshots are disabled by default, if you have the passcode lock enabled.

You can change this setting by going to: Settings > Privacy and Security > Passcode lock, then enable Allow Screen Capture and restart the app.

When this option is enabled, you will be able to take screenshots of the app, but the system will display your chats in the task switcher when the passcode is on. Please also note that you need to have enough space in your device’s memory to save screenshots.

{QUESTION}
I’ve heard Telegram was cracked by the FSB, is it true?
{KEYS}
fsb
guardian
{VALUE}
These rumors come from a "report" that is likely to be fake. See: https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/buzzfeed-publishes-donald-trump-russia-documents-ethics-questions.

If it's not, it probably refers to the story of SMS interception for two Russian oppositionary accounts that were not using 2-Step Verification: http://fortune.com/2016/05/06/telegram-activists-hack/. Tell me if you want to learn more about 2-Step Verification. 

As for the report, bear in mind that Journalists from the Guardian, the Financial Times, and other reputable papers have had it since June 2016 and to this day they are unable to confirm a single statement from it.

{QUESTION}
Why doesn’t Telegram prevent cheating in games built on our platform?
{KEYS}
cheat
cheats
cheating
cheaters
{VALUE}
Telegram's gaming platform enables bot developers to create in-chat games, but the Telegram team doesn’t control the way each game works, so cheating can occur. In order to prevent this, we would need to sync not only the results, but every action players take in every game, with the developer's server — which would be hard for developers to set up and maintain.

Cheating is a problem for many games, including those that are published on the App Store or Google Play. In each case, it is up to the game developers to catch any cheaters. As more and more games are published by third-party developers over time, we hope you will be able to find games that work just as you want them to.

We're currently aware of this issue. It's being looked into right now, and we are hoping to get it fixed as soon as possible. 

If you don't wish to wait for the fix, we can suggest a workaround: log in with our desktop app (desktop.telegram.org), find the group chat with an unread message there and open it to get rid of the extra notification.

Sorry for any inconvenience! We'll get back to you as soon as we have any news. Here’s a technical hashtag that will help us find your question: #issue_pzfSzLxW

We've noticed that you are using an unofficial Telegram app. Since Telegram apps are open-source, there are a lot of Telegram-based apps under different names and with different features, made by developers from all over the world.

You're totally free to choose the one you prefer. However, in order for us to help you, you'll need to download the official app from the Google Play Store:
https://telegram.org/dl/android

It's free, shows no ads and has the latest features first.
All your chats - apart from Secret Chats - will be safely transferred over, as they're stored in the Telegram Cloud.

Tell me if you want to learn more about it.

{QUESTION}

{COMMENT}
Only use this template if the user told us nothing but insults. Don't use this, if the user has a question on top of the insults (some start swearing when they think the answer takes too long, that's ok). If there is indeed a question - just ignore the insults and answer the question, this usually works in a sobering way for the offender.
{KEYS}

{QUESTION}

{KEYS}

{VALUE}
Unlike other messengers (e.g. WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.), Telegram's goal is not to earn money, but to offer fast, secure, and private messaging without any costs for the user or intrusive ads.

You can read more about our position on this in our FAQ:
https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this

{QUESTION}

But notice that Telegram requires an internet connection to work. Your mobile provider may charge you for sending and receiving data on your mobile phone.

{QUESTION}
Why is Telegram fast?
{KEYS}
fast
speed
sofast
faster
telegramfast
fasttelegram
{VALUE}
In order to work more reliably on weak mobile connections, we use a custom protocol. It allows us to send your encrypted messages using less data.

We also have a unique server infrastructure that allows you to communicate using servers close to you - which means that data needs to travel shorter distances. And sending less data over shorter distances means that we can do it faster than anybody else.

{QUESTION}
How does Telegram encryption work?
{KEYS}
crypto
encrypted
encryption
{VALUE}
We support two layers of secure encryption (server-client and client-client). Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, RSA 2048 encryption and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.

When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so called Diffie-Hellman key exchange. After the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.

You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure and no man-in-the-middle attack can possibly succeed.

You can find more info in the Advanced FAQ https://core.telegram.org/techfaq

{QUESTION}

Does Telegram read my messages? Do you?
{KEYS}
doyouread
canyouseemessages
canyoureadmessages
{VALUE}
We only read the messages that you send directly to us - for example, in this support chat. Telegram is not a commercial company, but a non-profit open source project that lives off a donation.

We created Telegram to make safe and free messaging available for everybody. Our reputation and your privacy are the only things that we care about.

In fact, you don't even need to trust us. If you use our end-to-end encrypted Secret chats, it is technically impossible for anyone except your recipient to read the messages.

Sorry, but we never promise exact release dates, as life might get in the way. It's easiest if you turn automatic updates on in Google's Play Store, Apple's App Store, or Windows Phone Store respectively. This way, you'll always be one of the first to get updates.

{QUESTION}
I'm worried about storing things in the cloud
{KEYS}
cloud
cloudsec
cloudsafe
safecloud
cloudsecurity
telegramcloud
{VALUE}
Security is one of Telegram's main attractions; everything you send and receive is heavily encrypted. Your cloud chat data is stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud.

And if you don't like the idea of syncing chats across many devices, try our Secret Chats. Messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption and can only be deciphered on you and your recipient's devices. They are not part of the cloud and can only be accessed on the device that you started them on. And if you log out on that device, they are gone.

{QUESTION}
Why did you call this Telegram?
{KEYS}

{VALUE}
The old-school telegram used to be the fastest, safest, and cheapest way for long-distance communication once; it brought people around the globe closer together than ever before (check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy).

That sounded a lot like us.

{QUESTION}
Can I hide my last seen time?
{KEYS}
inv
invisible
lastseen
hidelastseen
lastseenrecently
{VALUE}
You can set who can see your 'last seen time' in Privacy and Security settings.

You won‘t see 'Last Seen' timestamps for people with whom you don’t share your own. You will, however, see an approximate 'last seen' value. This keeps stalkers away but makes it easy to see whether a person is reachable over Telegram. There are four possible approximate values:

- Last seen recently — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days
- Last seen within a week — between 2-3 and 7 days
- Last seen within a month — between 6-7 days and a month
- Last seen a long time ago — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)

As you can see, these stages are not clearly separated, so you cannot calculate much from this data.

{QUESTION}
Can I hide my last seen time? (Desktop)
{KEYS}
invdesk

Our desktop version doesn‘t currently have the option to set who can see your last seen time, sorry. You can change it on your phone in Privacy and Security settings.

{QUESTION}
What do the green checks mean?
{KEYS}
2
two
tick
check
ticks
checks
onecheck
twochecks
greenchecks
{VALUE}
1 check = message delivered to the Telegram cloud (and is waiting for your chat partner to see it in Telegram), notification sent (if the recipient is accepting notifications).

2 checks = message read (recipient opened Telegram and the conversation with your message).

We don't have an additional status for 'message delivered to device', because you can use Telegram on multiple devices simultaneously. Since you don't know which one of their devices the person is actually using, delivery to one of the devices becomes irrelevant.

{QUESTION}
Can I hide my online status?
{KEYS}
online
hideonline
hidestatus
hideonlinestatus
{VALUE}
Your online status is only shown to those people that can see your last seen. If you don't share your last seen with them, they will only see you 'Online' when you're typing a message to them — or just sent one.

{QUESTION}
I deleted a chat by accident, can I restore it?
{KEYS}
restorechat
recoverchat
accidentdelete
deletedmessage
restoremessage
recovermessage

restoremessages
recovermessages
deletedchataccident
{VALUE}
Sorry, there is no way to restore chats or messages if you deleted them.

But hey, did you ask your chat partner if they still have the chat? If this wasn't a secret chat, your friend could manually forward you specific chat messages you need. And if it was a secret chat, they may be able to take screenshots for you or just copy the text if screenshots are disabled on their device.

{QUESTION}
How do I know who is using Telegram?
{KEYS}
who
whoshere
who'shere
onlinenow
whosusing
whosonline
who'susing
who'sonline
{VALUE}
Telegram regularly checks your device for new contacts. Your contacts who have Telegram are shown at the top of your Telegram contacts page, if they have set a Profile Picture that will also be shown there.

{QUESTION}
How can I make new friends here?
{KEYS}
newfriends
meetfriends
makefriends
{VALUE}
In Telegram, you can create a group with your friends, and then ask them to add their friends as well — an easy way to meet new people. Tell me if you'd like to learn how to create groups.

There are also unofficial bots designed for getting in touch with other users interested. Try searching the web for 'Telegram bots new friends' – you'll get many results.

Please remember: You can use Telegram search to find people you know by their usernames – but this is not a tool for finding new friends. People don't like it when strangers contact them via username search, so it might result in people reporting you.

{QUESTION}
Will you have video calls?
{KEYS}
tel
videocall
videocalls
{VALUE}
We are not working on this feature at the moment. For now, you can send a recorded video or a voice message to your Telegram friends.

{QUESTION}

{KEYS}

calloption

{VALUE}
We specialize in sending messages, large media and files to unlimited audiences — and we do this better than anyone out there. For the moment we see many things that could still be revolutionized in messaging. And messaging is obviously trending at the moment, so our focus remains in that area, at least for now. Stay tuned for our next updates.

If you would like to speak by voice, here’s another idea: you can send a recorded video or a voice message to your Telegram friends.

{QUESTION}
Can I archive or back up my conversations?
{KEYS}
backup
archive
backups
archives
{VALUE}
There is less need for backups in Telegram, because your chats are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud — and you can access them from any of your devices anytime. Secret Chats are the only exception to this rule: they are only available on their device of origin and are lost when you log out.

As long as you don't manually delete anything from a cloud chat, it stays there, even if you reinstall Telegram, use it on a second or third device or change your phone number.

If you need to copy certain messages, you can also use the Telegram web or desktop version. Both allow you to select multiple messages and paste into a text file, for example.
https://desktop.telegram.org
https://web.telegram.org

{QUESTION}
Will I know if somebody blocks me?
{KEYS}
blocked
imblocked
i'mblocked
whoblocked
userblocked
amiblocked
{VALUE}
You don't get a notification when you have been blocked by another person. Your messages just stop being delivered, they will always have 1 check.

Blocked people:

- can't send you messages, start secret chats with you or add you to groups
- can't see your profile picture
- can't see your online and last seen status; you always appear to them as 'last seen a long time ago' (or 'offline' in older versions of the apps).

{QUESTION}
What are gifs?
{KEYS}
gif
jif
gifs
jifs
gifsare
{VALUE}
GIFs are animated pictures - send them as a 'file' attachment (not as a photo) if you want them to be playable.

You can use our built-in GIF search or the inline bot: try typing '@gif cats' in the message field. The bot will then offer you GIFs relevant to your search term, in this case, 'cats'!

You can also reuse GIFs that you get from your friends: tap on them and select 'Save'. Then you can find them in the dedicated GIF tab in the stickers panel.

Then just switch to that keyboard whenever you're out of words ;-)

{QUESTION}
How can I send music from my iOS device?
{KEYS}
mp3
mp3i
musici
musicios
sendmusicios
{VALUE}
Unfortunately, Apple's operating system is very restricted - it does not allow you to access music files from your iTunes library. If you want to share music files, you'll need to keep them in a different app, e.g. iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.

{QUESTION}
What does 'name hidden' mean?
{KEYS}
namehidden
hiddenname
{VALUE}
'Name Hidden' or 'Unknown' instead of a name means that this person deleted their Telegram account.

{QUESTION}

We don't have an official store for stickers, the platform is open for anyone to use. If you'd like to get more stickers, there are a few ways:

1) Simply type '@sticker' in the input field, leave a space, and then enter one or more emoji - the bot will offer you some sticker suggestions to choose from.

2) If you receive a sticker you like, tap on it — the relevant sticker pack will open and you can add it to your sticker panel.

3) Browse and add the stickers that are currently trending on Telegram, by going to Telegram Settings > Stickers > Trending Stickers.

4) If that's not enough, you can try searching the web for 'Telegram Stickers' — you'll get many results.

{QUESTION}
What are channels?
{KEYS}
channels
channelsare
aboutchannels
{VALUE}
Channels are a tool for broadcasting your messages to large audiences — share important news, fun stuff, or anything you want. Unlike in a group, the recipients won't know about each other and it is only the administrators of the channel that will be able to send messages there.

Channels can have an unlimited number of members — and they can be public with a permanent URL so that everyone can find and join them. If you'd like an example, join our official Telegram channel to get notified about our updates: https://t.me/telegram

To create a channel:

iOS: Start a new message (tap the icon in the top-right corner in Chats). Then ‘New Channel’.

Android: Tap the pencil icon in the chat list. Then ‘New Channel’.

Windows Phone: Tap the '+' sign in the chat main menu. Then ‘New Channel’.

{QUESTION}
Where do I find new channels?

Sorry, we don't have an official list of Telegram channels. The best way of finding them now would be to search on the web for 'Telegram channels'.

{QUESTION}
How are supergroups different from groups?
{KEYS}
sg
supergroups
{VALUE}
Telegram groups are ideal for sharing things with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. They can have up to 200 members, by default everyone can add new members and edit the name and group photo.

Supergroups can have up to 5000 members. They have a unified history, so deleted messages will disappear for everyone, and ordinary members can only delete their own messages.

Here’s some extra information on how supergroups work:
- The entire message history is visible to new members that join the chat.
- They are muted by default and send fewer joined/left notifications.
- Admins can use pinned messages, displayed at the top of the chat, to inform members about important news that they might otherwise miss.
- They can be made public by setting a Username, just like channels.
- If made public, members can invite new people, if not, they can only join via invite link or if added by admins.

If you want to upgrade your group to a supergroup, go to Group Info and choose ‘Upgrade to Supergroup’. This action is irreversible, sorry — so please consider all the differences, and ask me if anything is unclear, before you upgrade.

botexamples
{VALUE}
We do not have an official store for bots, the platform is open for anyone to use. I'll give you a few examples – but please note that these bots were made by third-party developers, not by the Telegram team.

@TriviaBot – test your trivia knowledge or add to groups to compete with friends.
@hangbot – play the Hangman game online or add to groups to play together with your friends.
@AlertBot – set a time and this bot will send you a reminder.

Inline bots are even easier to use. You don't need to send them messages or add them to your groups – just type their @username in the message field in any chat, then type some keywords, and the bot will offer you relevant content. Here are several sample bots for you to try out: @gif, @vid, @pic, @bing, @wiki, @imdb, @bold.

If you'd like to find more bots, try searching the web for 'Telegram Bots' – you'll get many results.

If you are looking for a way to free your phone's memory, please note you can easily remove Telegram data from your device's local cache. Ask me if you would like to know more about it.

{QUESTION}
How do I manage cache? (Android)
{KEYS}
cachea
cacheandroid
{VALUE}
With Telegram, you don't need to store a lifetime of media history on your device. If you remove Telegram data from your device's local cache, it will re-download from the cloud whenever you want to access it again. This means, you won't lose anything and Telegram will always take the minimum amount of space.

Simply go to Telegram Settings > Data and Storage > Storage Usage and configure how long unused media stays on your devices. You can also clear cached data manually from that menu.

It is possible to clear cached files from individual supergroups and channels: tap and hold them in the chats list, then 'Delete from Cache'.

{QUESTION}

This means, you won't lose anything and Telegram will always take the minimum amount of space.

To manage cache, go to Telegram Settings > Data and Storage > Storage Usage. Here you can configure how long unused media stays on your device — or clear it manually, either by type or on a chat-by-chat basis.

You can move the Telegram app to the SD card, but media files will still be saved to the internal storage of your phone – it's not possible to change it at the moment.

If you are looking for a way to free your phone's memory, please note you can easily remove Telegram data from your device's local cache. Ask me if you would like to know more about it.

{QUESTION}
Why do I see a warning about scam in bot’s messages?
{KEYS}

lara
larabot
scambot
warning
{VALUE}
The warning is appended to messages automatically in order to highlight that the bot is not related to Telegram, and should be used with caution. It doesn't change the functionality of the bot in any way, but it means the bot was reported as a scam by Telegram users.

If you have any concerns about this, please contact the Telegram abuse department at abuse@telegram.org with all the details. I am sorry, but Telegram support is done by volunteers and we can't handle any cases related to scam reports here.

{QUESTION}
What is IFTTT and how do I use it?
{KEYS}
ifttt
{VALUE}
IFTTT is a free system that lets you link your Telegram account with other services to manage them inside of Telegram, or receive notifications, photos, or videos when something happens. For example, you can get a Telegram message when important emails arrive, turn on a smart TV, or control your Hue lights just by sending a Telegram message. You can also choose to let members of a group chat interact with your services or devices collaboratively.

To get started, just contact the @IFTTT bot, and follow the instructions it provides. In short, you will need to sign in with an IFTTT account, connect it with Telegram and then choose any applets you like from the list or create your own custom ones. IFTTT supports integration with social networks like Twitter and Instagram, tools like Gmail or Pocket, entertainment apps like Spotify or Pinterest, and various other apps — check https://ifttt.com/telegram for the full list.

-SECRET CHATS-
=========================

{QUESTION}
What are secret chats?
{KEYS}
schat
secretchat
secretchats
{VALUE}
Secret chats:

- Perfect as a temporary Chat
- Use end-to-end encryption
- Have an optional self-destruct timer
- No cloud synchronization
- Can only be used on one device
- Send a screenshot alert
- Are unusable after logging out
- Do not allow messages to be forwarded outside of them
- No data backup possible

To sum it up, Secret chats are super convenient for a short chat; for permanent conversations cloud chats are more convenient. All chats on Telegram are of course always encrypted. More about secret chats here: https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats

{QUESTION}
What are cloud chats?
{KEYS}
cchat
nchat
cloudchat
cloudchats
{VALUE}
Cloud chats (everything on Telegram except secret chats):

- Perfect for permanent chats
- Stay encrypted in the Telegram Cloud
- Can be used on any number of devices simultaneously
- Are restored when re-installing the app, also on a new device
- Content can be forwarded

To sum it up, the cloud chats on Telegram are encrypted and also always available for you in the Telegram cloud.

{QUESTION}
How are secret chats different from cloud chats?
{KEYS}
diff
schatvscchat
secretvscloud
secretchatvscloudchat
secretchatsvscloudchat
secretchatsvscloudchat
secrectcahtvscloudchats
{VALUE}
Telegram cloud chats (and groups) are securely encrypted in the Telegram cloud so that you can quickly access them from any of your devices, even if you reinstall the app. Only if you delete something in your chat is it gone forever (unless your chat partner can send it back to you).

Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption and can only be deciphered on the two participating devices. Downside of that: you can't access them from your other devices and if you reinstall Telegram, or even log out of your account, your secret chats will be lost.

Secret Chats also have an optional timer (from 1 second to 1 week) that allows you to send self-destructing messages, photos, videos and even files.

{QUESTION}
Why are Secret Chats only available on their devices of origin?
{KEYS}
1device
why1device
devicespecific
whydevicespecific
{VALUE}
While your Cloud Chats can be accessed from any of your devices anytime, Secret Chats are not part of the Telegram Cloud and are device-specific by design. This way you can always be sure that they are safe for as long as your phone is safe in your pocket. Secret Chats also use end-to-end encryption, so they can’t be synced in the same simple and convenient way as Cloud Chats. We may add support for multi-device Secret Chats in the future.

Meanwhile, if you want your conversations to be synced across many devices, consider using Cloud Chats. Please note that they are encrypted as well and are further protected by Telegram's distributed infrastructure. Let me know if you want to learn more about security on Telegram.

{QUESTION}
Why are there no Secret Chats on desktop apps?
{KEYS}
schatsd
secretchatsd
schatsdesktop
secretchatsdesktop
{VALUE}
Secret chats require permanent storage on the device, something that Telegram Desktop and Telegram Web don’t support at the moment. We may add this in the future. Currently, both the desktop and the web app load messages from the Cloud on startup and discard them when you quit. Since secret chats are not part of the cloud, this would kill all your secret chats each time you shut down your computer.

Secret chats are also device-specific and disappear if you log out — considering this, it is handier to keep them on the one device that you always carry with you. In case you are concerned about the security of your chats on desktop, please note that they are encrypted as well and are further protected by Telegram's distributed infrastructure. Let me know if you want to learn more about security on Telegram.

{QUESTION}
Tell me more about security on Telegram
{KEYS}
securitylm
securitymore
securitylearn
securitylearnmore
{VALUE}
All Telegram data is encrypted and cannot be deciphered by your ISP, network administrator or random hackers. Cloud chats are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud, and the keys needed to decipher this data are kept in other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way, local intruders or engineers can't access this data, and several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up anything. More on this in the FAQ: https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests

Secret chats are meant for people who want even more than that. They use end-to-end encryption, so there is no way to decipher your data without accessing your device. It means you don‘t even need to trust Telegram when you use Secret Chats — their secrecy is guaranteed client-side and anyone can check the source code of Telegram clients.

If you are concerned about security in general, there are other important precautions you could take. Consider protecting your account by enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, then it won’t be possible to access your chats by stealing your device or even by intercepting your SMS code. You will find both options in ‘Settings’ under ‘Privacy and Security’, ask me if you’d like more details.

{QUESTION}

-USERNAMES-
======================

{QUESTION}
How do usernames work?
{KEYS}
un
username
usernames
{VALUE}
You can pick a public Telegram username so that other users can find you using global search. This means that people will be able to contact you or add you to groups, even if they don't have your phone number. If you do not want that, simply don't set up a user name.

Usernames must have at least 5 characters and cannot start or end with underscores (_).
Once you've set up a username, you will also be able to use your personal Telegram link:
t.me/YourUsername
It will open a chat with you on Telegram — perfect for sharing with friends or putting up on your website or social network profiles.

Android: To set up a username, swipe the chat list to the right to open the menu, then 'Settings' > 'Username'.

iOS: To set up a username, go to Settings > Username.

WP: To set up a username, tap '...' in the chat list to go to Settings, then 'Set Username'.

Desktop: To set up a username, tap the menu icon near the search field, then 'Settings' > 'Choose Username'.

Web: To set up a username, go to Settings, then 'Set username'.

Android: Tap the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner in the chat list, then type in the search box.

iOS: Scroll a little up in the chats list, then type in the search box above.

WP: Go to Contacts view, then tap the magnifying glass icon and type in the search box.

{QUESTION}
My username is already taken, can I get it?
{KEYS}
wantusername
usernametaken
usernameoccupied
usernamesquatted
{VALUE}
Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come - first serve basis, sorry about this. How about an alternative way of writing the name?

We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us. If your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it, provided that you have exactly the same username on at least two of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

If this is the case with you, we would ask you to post something on both those services so that we can confirm that they indeed belong to you. E.g. you could say something like 'This is for the Telegram Support. Please give me my username'. Once you've done that, please send us the links to those posts here. (You can later remove the posts, but please let us see them first.)

{QUESTION}
How do I verify my account?
{KEYS}
verifyu
verifyuser
{VALUE}
I am sorry, but Telegram doesn’t verify user accounts at the moment. Verification is only available for big and active official channels and bots.

Please note that verification doesn’t give any extra abilities in Telegram. It is only of use if you want to demonstrate that your account here is official. If this is the case with you, here’s another idea: you could post your Telegram username on your official site or any official account you have elsewhere — this will prove you are you to your audience and help them find you here.

{QUESTION}
How do I verify my channel?
{KEYS}
verifych
verifychannel
{VALUE}
The Telegram team generally verifies large and active official channels that have verified accounts on other services and social media platforms. If this is the case, we would ask you to announce your Telegram channel on these accounts or on your official website and send us a link - so that we can confirm that it indeed belongs to you.

Unfortunately we currently can't guarantee verification due to the amount of requests we get. Please kindly note that verification doesn't give any extra abilities in Telegram - it is only of use if you want to demonstrate that your channel is official. A link on your official site or another official account elsewhere can achieve a similar result.

{QUESTION}
How can I delete my username?
{KEYS}

In order to set up a passcode, go to Telegram Settings > Privacy and Security > Passcode Lock.

Once you set up a passcode, a lock icon will appear in your chats list. Tap on it to lock the app — your passcode will be required next time you open Telegram.

When the app is locked, text and sender's name are hidden in notifications. You can also enable auto-lock in Passcode Settings, if you don't want to lock the app manually.

{QUESTION}
What does the lock icon in my chats list mean?
{KEYS}

{VALUE}
This icon appears when you set up a passcode. Tap on it to lock the app - your passcode will be required next time you open Telegram.

When the app is locked, text and sender's name are hidden in notifications. You can also enable auto-lock in Passcode Settings, if you don't want to lock the app manually.

If you want to, you can disable this Passcode via Telegram Settings > Privacy and Security > Passcode Lock.

{QUESTION}
Can I make the app require my passcode immediately?
{KEYS}
locknow
alwaysask
passcodenow
passcodeimmediately
{VALUE}
If you don't want to lock the app manually, you can enable auto-lock in Passcode Settings.

At the moment the smallest available setting is 1 minute, which works for most users — this way the app locks pretty quickly, but you don't need to key in the code if a new message arrives just as you've put the phone back in your pocket.

We may add more settings in future versions.

{QUESTION}
How do I unlock my app with Touch ID?
{KEYS}
touchid
{VALUE}
First, make sure you have Touch ID set up, you can configure it in iOS Settings:

Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Add a fingerprint.

You can deactivate your Telegram account here:
https://telegram.org/deactivate
We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.

Please note:
- A confirmation code will be sent to you via Telegram (not in an SMS).
- If you delete your account now, it may not be possible to sign up again immediately.

By the way, may we ask why you are leaving? Missing a feature? Any other troubles?

{QUESTION}

{KEYS}

{VALUE}
The phone number is currently the only way for us to identify a Telegram user.

We collect no other information on you, and this means: whoever owns the number, owns the account. Unfortunately, to delete any data from an account, you need access to that account. In order to delete the account, you need to be logged in at least on one of your devices.

You can read more about it here:
https://telegram.org/faq#q-my-phone-was-stolen-what-do-i-do

Please note, that Telegram accounts have a self-destruct option that is enabled by default. This means that all Telegram accounts are automatically deleted after 6 months of inactivity (you can manually change this in Settings — Privacy and Security, with options ranging from 1 month to 1 year).

{QUESTION}
How do I change my phone number in Telegram?
{KEYS}
change
changenumber
switchnumber
{VALUE}
You can move your Telegram account with all your contacts, cloud chats, groups, username and block list to a new number.

To do this: go to Telegram Settings > Phone number > Change number > type in your new number. If necessary, enter the code you will receive via an SMS to the new number - done!

For this to work, please make sure there is no existing Telegram account connected to the new number. If there is, please delete this new account before starting the transfer. Note that your contacts will have your new number added to their address book, provided they had your old number in their phone book and you have not blocked them in Telegram.

{QUESTION}
Why do I need to keep my number up to date?
{KEYS}

updatenumber

{VALUE}
It is important to keep your Telegram number up to date, since your provider may reassign your number to a different person when you stop using your old SIM. And in the current system the owner of the number is the owner or the Telegram account as well.

To change your number in Telegram, go to Settings, then tap on your number and then 'Change number'.

Note that when you change your number, your Telegram contacts will get the new number added to their address book — provided they had your older number and you haven't blocked them in Telegram.

{QUESTION}
I try to change my phone number in Telegram but it says my new number is already connected to an account.
{KEYS}
occupied
occupiednumber
{VALUE}
If you want to change your current phone number in Telegram, you must first ensure that the your new number does not have a Telegram account connected to it. If there is one, you need to delete it before starting the transfer.

Note: If you delete the account currently connected to your new number, it cannot be recovered - so please make sure you don't need the account before deleting it.

If you wish to continue, below are the easiest steps to perform this process. We also recommend that you use a non-mobile browser to do this.

1. Use any of our apps to log in with the account currently associated with your new number - e.g. go to https://web.telegram.org, enter your new phone number there and log in using the code you receive via SMS to the number.
2. Once logged into the new numbers account, navigate to https://telegram.org/deactivate and enter your new phone number there, in international format. You will now receive a password through Telegram (keep an eye on the app you logged on to in step 1). Enter the password and delete the account.
3. Now, open your main account on a mobile device, go to Telegram Settings > Phone number > Change number > type in your new number. If necessary, enter the code you will receive via an SMS to the new number

Done!

{KEYS}

phonestolen
{VALUE}

First of all, sorry about your phone. Unfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment, so for now you'll need to follow these steps:

1. First and foremost, you need to contact your SIM provider so that they can block your old SIM and issue you with a new one with the same number.
2. If you are logged in to Telegram on any of your other devices, go to Settings - Terminate all other sessions. This will log out all other devices. If the old SIM has been blocked by this time, nobody can access your data. You can resume ordinary Telegram usage.
3. If you are not logged in to Telegram, wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings - Terminate all other sessions. Then you can resume ordinary Telegram usage.

Please note, that Telegram accounts have a self-destruct option that is enabled by default. This means that all Telegram accounts are automatically deleted after 6 months of inactivity (you can manually change this in Settings - Privacy and Security, with options ranging from 1 month to 1 year).

{QUESTION}
How do I log out of Telegram?
{KEYS}
logout
{VALUE}
Generally, logging out is not necessary when using Telegram, since you can have it running on all your devices at the same time. Did you know that when you log in again, you can get the code in any other Telegram app instead of an SMS? — provided that app was recently active. You can do this to save time when logging in.

Android: Swipe left in Chats list to open the menu, then Settings — tap '...' in the top right corner — 'Logout'.

iOS: Settings — Edit — scroll all the way down, then 'Logout'.

WP: Tap '...' in the Chat view — Settings — scroll all the way down, then 'Logout'.

macOS: File — Log Out.

Remember that if you log out, you will lose all your Secret Chats.

{QUESTION}

{KEYS}

{VALUE}
Generally, logging out is not necessary when using Telegram, since you can have it running on all your devices at the same time. If you want to lock it from other users of your device, you can set a passcode: Settings — Turn on local passcode. When it’s set, you can lock the app by tapping a lock icon near the search field, and no one will be able to open it without entering your passcode.

To log out, go to Settings — Log Out.

When you're using an older Android device with little RAM, it may sometimes have issues with the notification service. This could lead Android to closing the service. If you think this is the case, regularly restarting the device could solve that issue.

During the installation of Telegram, your system asked you to confirm push notifications. If you rejected, notifications won't work. You'll have to reinstall the app in order to enable them — sorry, but Windows Phone doesn't offer an alternative way at the moment.
Please note that secret chats will be lost on reinstall. Other chats are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud, so you will safely keep them if you reinstall Telegram.

First of all, make sure that you have Contacts permissions enabled for Telegram in your phone settings. If you can see some of your contacts in the Telegram Contacts menu, it means that the permission is already enabled and you can proceed to the next step at once.

Then please try this trick: open the Telegram Settings menu, scroll all the way down and press and hold on the "Telegram for Android" text section until you see a small emoticon appear. Then let go and press and hold the same area again. When the "Debug Menu" appears, tap on "Reload Contacts" there.

Sorry to hear about your connection problems. Can you please help us investigate this? Here are a few important questions:

0. Do other apps work OK?
1. What exactly is happening? (always 'connecting...' / always 'updating...' / seems ok, but messages are not sent / not delivered, etc.)
2. At what time did it start? Is it still happening?
3. Is this happening all the time or sometimes?
4. Does this happen with all Telegram apps - or just on one of your devices?
4a. (Try web.telegram.org - does it work?)
5. Does the problem happen on Wi-Fi, on mobile connection or in both cases?

How can I stop Telegram from using so much battery? (Android)
{KEYS}
drain
battery
savebattery
{VALUE}
There could be several reasons why Telegram is using a lot of battery on your Android device.

Please check the following:

- If you have a Battery Optimizer, Task Manager, Task Killer, or something similar installed: please put Telegram on the list of allowed apps (whitelist). If not whitelisted, the Telegram process will be restarted again and again when closed, and this will use a lot of energy from your device.

- Telegram uses Google Cloud Notifications (GCM) to wake the app and notify you for new messages. So make sure Google Play Services are installed on your phone.

Since GCM are not very reliable, we added an extra system to help notify you when new messages arrive. You can manage this system by toggling the "Keep-Alive Service", and "Background Connection" options, near the bottom of Telegram Settings > Notifications and Sounds.

Both settings may affect your battery life. If you toggle them both off and use only Google Cloud Notifications, this could result in unreliable notifications.

{QUESTION}
What about IND-CCA?
{COMMENT}
{KEYS}
indcca
{VALUE}
The gist, for non-technical readers, is this: Somebody can take an encrypted message after it was sent (without knowing what was inside), add some symbols to the ciphertext (without being able to alter the actual message inside), and pass it on to you. After decryption, you will receive the same message that was sent and only you and the sender will know what was in it.

Properties like IND-CCA are convenient for theoretical definitions and scientific inquiry, but they are not directly related to the actual security of communication.

To put this case into familiar terms:

A postal worker can write ‘Haha’ (using invisible ink!) on the outside of a sealed package that he delivers to you. It doesn‘t stop the package from being delivered, it doesn’t allow them to change the contents of the package, and it doesn't allow them to see what was inside.

Here's a link to this in our Technical FAQ, just in case:

I think I was hacked, what do I do?

Some social engineers were tricking users into 'sharing screenshots' that would feature the login code, etc.

When you log in to Telegram, we send you a message with a login code. DO NOT GIVE THIS CODE TO ANYONE. If you give your code to people, they will be able to log in to your account.

To see all active sessions for your Telegram account, go to Settings — Privacy and Security — Active Sessions. If you see anything suspicious, you can terminate the session there.

You can also set up an additional password for your account. To do this, go to Settings — Privacy and Security — Two-Step Verification. Once enabled, you will need both a password AND a code to log in to Telegram.

I’ve read there’s a paper revealing several major exploits in Telegram!

This article is misleading. The author dismisses the Telegram protocol as insecure based on a piece of research that doesn't prove this point.

Here's a detailed explanation of how J. Jakobsen's paper creates a false impression about Telegram's security:

I read an article that Telegram was hacked, what do you say?

This article is misleading clickbait, I'm afraid. Nothing was hacked — the author was simply looking to advertise his product. This article sounds ridiculous to any security specialist (e.g. take at look at the comments on Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9095059).

In plain words it says something like "If I had a key to your home, I could open your door".

So you needn't worry if you don't give away your keys. To keep your device safe, avoid clicking on suspicious links, always keep your system updated to the latest version — and don't root your device.

And never trust people who try to scare you into buying their software.
